**Areas:**Â _Zone of responsibility with standard to uphold over long periods_, parent, animals, management, coding, house.
    - Areas areÂ **the personal**Â bucket of your life for important things that don't have an end date. You won't ever "stop" working on your health; for example, it's a constant ongoing thing.
    - While areas can (and often do) generate projects, they are not linked since it's already intuitive which areas a project comes from, so there's no need to create an explicit link between, for example, the "Server maintenance" project and the "Sysadmin" area.
    - Finally, because they are personal, areas contain information you wrote forÂ _yourself only_Â about those areas in your life. Which is opposite to 3. Resources.
