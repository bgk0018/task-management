**Archives:**Â _Where stuff from all the other category become unused_, finished project, change of responsibility, etc.
    - This folder will be where you put things you won't need for a while, as the name suggests. For the most part, something in there won't be seen for a time, and that's why it has the lowest actionability, but sometimes a new project could use things in there, or a change of areas might mean you need to get stuff out of there.
    - For example, you have lots of notes on living with a pet in a small apartment, and then you move to a new bigger one. You could move all those to the archive if one day you have to go back to a small apartment again take them out.
