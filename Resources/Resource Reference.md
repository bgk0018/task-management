**Resources:**Â _Zone of interest for various topics that don't require standard/responsibility_, game, cooking, productivity, technology.
    - Resources areÂ **generally helpful for others**, not just you. For example, if someone was to ask you for information about cooking, you could zip that folder and send it to them.
    - The folders in there will very often reflect your various interests, what you're curious about and want to learn more about.
    - They are not necessarily actual "resources" as in PDF, Pictures, etc. they can also be notes about those subjects
